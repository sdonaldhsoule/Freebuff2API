# Freebuff2API

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Freebuff2API is an OpenAI-compatible proxy server for [Freebuff](https://freebuff.com). It translates standard OpenAI API requests into Freebuff's backend format, allowing you to use Freebuff's free models with any OpenAI-compatible client, SDK, or CLI tool.

## Features

- **OpenAI Compatible API** — Standard OpenAI endpoints; works with any compatible client out of the box.
- **Stealth Request Handling** — Dynamic, randomized client fingerprints that mimic official Freebuff SDK behavior.
- **Multi-Token Rotation** — Cycle through multiple auth tokens with automatic periodic rotation.
- **HTTP Proxy Support** — Route all outbound traffic through a configurable upstream proxy.

## Getting Auth Tokens

Freebuff2API requires one or more Freebuff **auth tokens**. There are two ways to obtain one:

### Method 1 — Web (Recommended)

Visit **[https://freebuff.llm.pm](https://freebuff.llm.pm)**, log in with your Freebuff account, and your auth token will be displayed directly on the page. Copy it as your **AUTH_TOKENS** — no local installation required.

### Method 2 — Freebuff CLI

Install the Freebuff CLI:

```bash
npm i -g freebuff
```

Run `freebuff` in your terminal — on first launch it will guide you through login.

After logging in, your token is saved to a local credentials file:

| OS | Credentials Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `C:\Users\<username>\.config\manicode\credentials.json` |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.config/manicode/credentials.json` |

The file looks like:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "id": "user_10293847",
    "name": "Zhang San",
    "email": "zhangsan@example.com",
    "authToken": "fa82b5c1-e39d-4c7a-961f-d2b3c4e5f6a7",
    ...
  }
}
```

Only the `authToken` value is needed — copy it as your **AUTH_TOKENS**.

> **Tip:** Log in with multiple accounts and configure all their tokens for higher throughput.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed via a JSON file and/or environment variables. The JSON keys and environment variable names are identical. By default the app looks for `config.json` in the working directory; use `-config` to specify another path.

```json
{
  "LISTEN_ADDR": ":8080",
  "UPSTREAM_BASE_URL": "https://codebuff.com",
  "AUTH_TOKENS": ["eyJhb..."],
  "ROTATION_INTERVAL": "6h",
  "REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "15m",
  "API_KEYS": [],
  "HTTP_PROXY": ""
}
```

### Reference

| Key / Env Var | Description |
|---|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | Proxy listen address (default `:8080`) |
| `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` | Freebuff backend URL (default `https://codebuff.com`) |
| `AUTH_TOKENS` | Freebuff auth tokens (JSON array or comma-separated env var) |
| `ROTATION_INTERVAL` | Run rotation interval (default `6h`) |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Upstream request timeout (default `15m`) |
| `API_KEYS` | Client API keys for proxy auth (empty = open access) |
| `HTTP_PROXY` | HTTP proxy for outbound requests |

Environment variables override JSON values when both are set.

## Deployment

### Docker

Pre-built multi-arch images are available on GHCR:

```bash
docker run -d --name Freebuff2API \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e AUTH_TOKENS="token1,token2" \
  ghcr.io/quorinex/freebuff2api:latest
```

Build from source:

```bash
docker build -t Freebuff2API .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e AUTH_TOKENS="token1,token2" Freebuff2API
```

### Build from Source

**Requirements:** Go 1.23+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quorinex/Freebuff2API.git
cd Freebuff2API
go build -o Freebuff2API .
./Freebuff2API -config config.json
```
